Paper Bootstrap
===============

Bootstrap with Material Design.

Currently it's a Bootstrap v3.3.1 customization. After all built-in components are properly rewritten, I will create some paper elements according to Polymer Project.

Code released under the MIT license(see LICENSE.md). I am not sure if I can do customization without creating a fork. If what I did was illegal, please open an issue to tell me. I will remove this repo ASAP.
